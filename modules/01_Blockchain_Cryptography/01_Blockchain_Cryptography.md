# Blockchain Technology Cheatsheet

Welcome to the Alchemy University's Ethereum Developer Bootcamp! This cheatsheet summarizes essential concepts in blockchain technology, focusing on Ethereum, smart contracts, and cryptographic primitives.

## üìö Blockchains

### üéØ Purpose of a Blockchain

- To create a **network of computers** that agree on a **common state of data**.
- Participation should be open to **any person or organization**.
- No single entity should be able to control the process.
- This process of agreement is called **consensus**.

---

## üí∏ Cryptocurrency Use-Case

### Why Blockchain is Needed

A naive digital currency without blockchain relies on a **centralized bookkeeper** and raises issues:

1. Trust in the bookkeeper (resistance to cheating/bribery).
2. Availability and up-to-date balances.
3. Scalability with increasing participants.

Blockchain solves **problem #1 ‚Äî trust** ‚Äî using **decentralization and cryptography**.

### üîç The Breakthrough

- In 2008, **Satoshi Nakamoto** proposed Bitcoin.
- Bitcoin described a **peer-to-peer value exchange system**.
- The system used **cryptography and game theory** to incentivize honest behavior.
- Data was stored in a **chain of cryptographically-linked blocks**, hence the term **blockchain**.

## üß† Smart Contract Blockchains

Smart contracts allow **code to run on a decentralized network**, making them:

- **Censorship-resistant**
- **Publicly accessible**
- **Transparent and verifiable**

### Example: Solidity Smart Contract

```solidity
// this data structure will keep track of which address has a balance
mapping(address => uint) balances;

function transfer(address to, uint amount) external {
  // subtract the amount from the sender's balance
  balances[msg.sender] -= amount;

  // add the amount to the recipient's balance
  balances[to] += amount;
}
```

- This is a basic ERC20 `transfer()` function.
- **Nothing special** about the function until it is **deployed to a blockchain**.
- Once deployed, its execution is **enforced by all nodes in the network**.

## üîê Cryptographic Hash Functions

### What is a Hash Function?

A **hash function** takes an input of any size and returns a **fixed-size output**.

| Input              | Input Size    | Output (Hash) | Output Size |
|--------------------|---------------|---------------|-------------|
| `52`               | 8 bytes       | `0x41cf...`   | 32 bytes    |
| `"happy times"`    | 22 bytes      | `0xd6bf...`   | 32 bytes    |
| `monalisa.jpg`     | 875000 bytes  | `0x7cde...`   | 32 bytes    |
| `worldseries.mp4`  | 1.6e+10 bytes | `0x9c0e...`   | 32 bytes    |

### üîí Cryptographic Hash Function Properties

1. **Deterministic**: Same input ‚Üí same output
2. **Pseudorandom**: Outputs appear random and unpredictable
3. **One-way**: Infeasible to reverse-engineer the input
4. **Fast to Compute**: Efficient computation
5. **Collision-resistant**: Very unlikely two inputs produce same output

> Challenge: Try using a [SHA-256 tool](https://emn178.github.io/online-tools/sha256.html) and test these properties!

### üß† Why Hashing Matters for Blockchains

- **Save space**: Store hash instead of large inputs.
- **Enable validation**: Confirm data without storing all of it.
- **Foundation for consensus**: Core to Proof of Work systems.

---

## üß© Summary

- **Blockchain**: Decentralized ledger for trustless consensus.
- **Cryptocurrency**: First major use-case enabled by blockchain.
- **Smart Contracts**: Decentralized logic enforcing financial and programmatic rules.
- **Cryptographic Hash Functions**: Vital primitive for security, storage, and consensus.

# Public Key Cryptography Cheatsheet

---

## üîê Cryptography Historically

- Until the 1970s, cryptography focused on **encrypting messages** to keep them secret.
- Messages were encrypted by applying simple functions, e.g., shifting letters ("abc" ‚Üí "bcd").
- Early encryption was **easy to break** once the secret method was known.
- Introduction of **secret keys** allowed two parties to agree on a key before communication.
- This is called **symmetric-key cryptography**: both sides share the same secret key.
- Cryptography evolved with more complex methods over time.

---

## üñ•Ô∏è Personal Computing and New Challenges

- Personal computing raised the problem: How to communicate **securely without prior key exchange**?
- Meeting in person to exchange keys was impractical.
- In 1976, **Whitfield Diffie** proposed the idea of a **public key**.
- Many initially rejected this because keys were meant to be private.

---

## üí° Thought Experiment: Public and Private Keys

- There exists a **key pair**: a **private key** and a **public key**.
- Each key can decrypt messages encrypted by the other.
- Bob publishes his **public key** widely but keeps his **private key** secret.

### Digital Signatures (Proof of Origin)

- Bob **encrypts a message with his private key**.
- Anyone can decrypt it with Bob's public key.
- Only Bob could have created the message ‚Äî **this forms a digital signature**.

### Confidential Messages

- Anyone can encrypt a message using Bob's **public key**.
- Only Bob can decrypt it with his **private key**.
- Enables **secure communication without prior key exchange**.

---

## üîÑ Asymmetric Encryption

- Public key cryptography is **asymmetric**:
  - One key (public) encrypts.
  - The other key (private) decrypts.
- Only the owner has access to the private key.

---

## ‚öôÔ∏è Popular Algorithms: RSA and ECDSA

### RSA (Rivest‚ÄìShamir‚ÄìAdleman)

- Based on the difficulty of **factoring large products of two primes**.
- Easy to multiply two primes, but hard to factor the product.
- Security depends on computational hardness (relates to **P vs NP problem**).
- Widely studied and used in many cryptographic systems.

### ECDSA (Elliptic Curve Digital Signature Algorithm)

- Uses **elliptic curves** for cryptography.
- Provides the same security with **smaller key sizes** compared to RSA.
- Used in Bitcoin and many cryptocurrencies (e.g., secp256k1 curve).
- Popular due to efficiency and strong security.

---

## üìö Summary

- Cryptography evolved from simple secret-key methods to **asymmetric public-key systems**.
- Public key cryptography solves the problem of **secure communication without prior key exchange**.
- Digital signatures provide **proof of message origin and integrity**.
- RSA and ECDSA are two main algorithms powering modern secure communications and blockchain technology.
