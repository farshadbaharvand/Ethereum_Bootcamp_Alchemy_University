# Blockchain Technology Cheatsheet

Welcome to the Alchemy University's Ethereum Developer Bootcamp! This cheatsheet summarizes essential concepts in blockchain technology, focusing on Ethereum, smart contracts, and cryptographic primitives.

---

## üìö Blockchains

### üéØ Purpose of a Blockchain

- To create a **network of computers** that agree on a **common state of data**.
- Participation should be open to **any person or organization**.
- No single entity should be able to control the process.
- This process of agreement is called **consensus**.

---

## üí∏ Cryptocurrency Use-Case

### Why Blockchain is Needed

A naive digital currency without blockchain relies on a **centralized bookkeeper** and raises issues:

1. Trust in the bookkeeper (resistance to cheating/bribery).
2. Availability and up-to-date balances.
3. Scalability with increasing participants.

Blockchain solves **problem #1 ‚Äî trust** ‚Äî using **decentralization and cryptography**.

### üîç The Breakthrough

- In 2008, **Satoshi Nakamoto** proposed Bitcoin.
- Bitcoin described a **peer-to-peer value exchange system**.
- The system used **cryptography and game theory** to incentivize honest behavior.
- Data was stored in a **chain of cryptographically-linked blocks**, hence the term **blockchain**.

---

## üß† Smart Contract Blockchains

Smart contracts allow **code to run on a decentralized network**, making them:

- **Censorship-resistant**
- **Publicly accessible**
- **Transparent and verifiable**

### Example: Solidity Smart Contract

```solidity
// this data structure will keep track of which address has a balance
mapping(address => uint) balances;

function transfer(address to, uint amount) external {
  // subtract the amount from the sender's balance
  balances[msg.sender] -= amount;

  // add the amount to the recipient's balance
  balances[to] += amount;
}
```

- This is a basic ERC20 `transfer()` function.
- **Nothing special** about the function until it is **deployed to a blockchain**.
- Once deployed, its execution is **enforced by all nodes in the network**.

---

## üîê Cryptographic Hash Functions

### What is a Hash Function?

A **hash function** takes an input of any size and returns a **fixed-size output**.

| Input              | Input Size    | Output (Hash) | Output Size |
|--------------------|---------------|---------------|-------------|
| `52`               | 8 bytes       | `0x41cf...`   | 32 bytes    |
| `"happy times"`    | 22 bytes      | `0xd6bf...`   | 32 bytes    |
| `monalisa.jpg`     | 875000 bytes  | `0x7cde...`   | 32 bytes    |
| `worldseries.mp4`  | 1.6e+10 bytes | `0x9c0e...`   | 32 bytes    |

### üîí Cryptographic Hash Function Properties

1. **Deterministic**: Same input ‚Üí same output
2. **Pseudorandom**: Outputs appear random and unpredictable
3. **One-way**: Infeasible to reverse-engineer the input
4. **Fast to Compute**: Efficient computation
5. **Collision-resistant**: Very unlikely two inputs produce same output

> Challenge: Try using a [SHA-256 tool](https://emn178.github.io/online-tools/sha256.html) and test these properties!

### üß† Why Hashing Matters for Blockchains

- **Save space**: Store hash instead of large inputs.
- **Enable validation**: Confirm data without storing all of it.
- **Foundation for consensus**: Core to Proof of Work systems.

---

## üß© Summary

- **Blockchain**: Decentralized ledger for trustless consensus.
- **Cryptocurrency**: First major use-case enabled by blockchain.
- **Smart Contracts**: Decentralized logic enforcing financial and programmatic rules.
- **Cryptographic Hash Functions**: Vital primitive for security, storage, and consensus.

---

# Public Key Cryptography Cheatsheet

---

## üîê Cryptography Historically

- Until the 1970s, cryptography focused on **encrypting messages** to keep them secret.
- Messages were encrypted by applying simple functions, e.g., shifting letters ("abc" ‚Üí "bcd").
- Early encryption was **easy to break** once the secret method was known.
- Introduction of **secret keys** allowed two parties to agree on a key before communication.
- This is called **symmetric-key cryptography**: both sides share the same secret key.
- Cryptography evolved with more complex methods over time.

---

## üñ•Ô∏è Personal Computing and New Challenges

- Personal computing raised the problem: How to communicate **securely without prior key exchange**?
- Meeting in person to exchange keys was impractical.
- In 1976, **Whitfield Diffie** proposed the idea of a **public key**.
- Many initially rejected this because keys were meant to be private.

---

## üí° Thought Experiment: Public and Private Keys

- There exists a **key pair**: a **private key** and a **public key**.
- Each key can decrypt messages encrypted by the other.
- Bob publishes his **public key** widely but keeps his **private key** secret.

### Digital Signatures (Proof of Origin)

- Bob **encrypts a message with his private key**.
- Anyone can decrypt it with Bob's public key.
- Only Bob could have created the message ‚Äî **this forms a digital signature**.

### Confidential Messages

- Anyone can encrypt a message using Bob's **public key**.
- Only Bob can decrypt it with his **private key**.
- Enables **secure communication without prior key exchange**.

---

## üîÑ Asymmetric Encryption

- Public key cryptography is **asymmetric**:
  - One key (public) encrypts.
  - The other key (private) decrypts.
- Only the owner has access to the private key.

---

## ‚öôÔ∏è Popular Algorithms: RSA and ECDSA

### RSA (Rivest‚ÄìShamir‚ÄìAdleman)

- Based on the difficulty of **factoring large products of two primes**.
- Easy to multiply two primes, but hard to factor the product.
- Security depends on computational hardness (relates to **P vs NP problem**).
- Widely studied and used in many cryptographic systems.

### ECDSA (Elliptic Curve Digital Signature Algorithm)

- Uses **elliptic curves** for cryptography.
- Provides the same security with **smaller key sizes** compared to RSA.
- Used in Bitcoin and many cryptocurrencies (e.g., secp256k1 curve).
- Popular due to efficiency and strong security.

---

## üìö Summary

- Cryptography evolved from simple secret-key methods to **asymmetric public-key systems**.
- Public key cryptography solves the problem of **secure communication without prior key exchange**.
- Digital signatures provide **proof of message origin and integrity**.
- RSA and ECDSA are two main algorithms powering modern secure communications and blockchain technology.

# ECDSA: Elliptic Curve Digital Signature Algorithm Cheatsheet

## Overview

ECDSA (Elliptic Curve Digital Signature Algorithm) is a cryptographic signature scheme that uses elliptic curve cryptography (ECC) to provide secure and efficient digital signatures.

- Based on the **Elliptic Curve Discrete Logarithm Problem (ECDLP)**
- Uses **elliptic curves over finite fields**
- Provides **smaller key sizes** and **faster computations** than RSA for equivalent security

---

## Key Concepts

- **Elliptic Curve (EC)**: Defined by an equation in Weierstrass form over a finite field
- **Generator Point (G)**: A predefined EC point used for scalar multiplication
- **Order (n)**: The number of points in the subgroup generated by G
- **Private Key (privKey)**: A random integer ‚àà [1, n - 1]
- **Public Key (pubKey)**: EC point `privKey * G`

---

## Example Curve: secp256k1

- Used in Bitcoin and Ethereum
- 256-bit security level

**Parameters:**
```
Order n:
115792089237316195423570985008687907852837564279074904382605163141518161494337

Generator G:
x = 55066263022277343669578718895168534326250603453777594175500187360389116729240
y = 32670510020758816978083085130507043184471273380659243275938904335757337482424
```

---

## Key Generation

1. Generate a random `privKey` in `[1, n - 1]`
2. Compute `pubKey = privKey * G`

**Public key compression:**
- Store only x-coordinate + 1-bit parity
- ~33 bytes for secp256k1

---

## ECDSA Signing

### Input
- Message `msg`
- Private key `privKey`

### Output
- Signature `{r, s}`

### Steps
1. Compute hash:  
   ```h = hash(msg)```

2. Generate random `k ‚àà [1, n - 1]`  
   - Use deterministic `k` from RFC 6979 if needed

3. Compute point:  
   ```R = k * G```  
   ```r = R.x mod n```

4. Compute signature proof:  
   ```
   s = k‚Åª¬π * (h + r * privKey) mod n
   ```

5. Output signature:  
   ```{r, s}```

---

## ECDSA Verification

### Input
- Message `msg`
- Signature `{r, s}`
- Public key `pubKey`

### Output
- Boolean: `true` (valid) or `false` (invalid)

### Steps
1. Compute hash:  
   ```h = hash(msg)```

2. Compute inverse:  
   ```s1 = s‚Åª¬π mod n```

3. Recover point:  
   ```
   R' = (h * s1) * G + (r * s1) * pubKey
   ```

4. Get x-coordinate:  
   ```r' = R'.x mod n```

5. Validate:  
   ```r' == r```

---

## How the Math Works

### Signature Equation
```
s = k‚Åª¬π * (h + r * privKey) mod n
```

### Verification Recovers:
```
R' = (h + r * privKey) * s‚Åª¬π * G
   = k * G
```

### Valid if:
```
R'.x == r
```

---

## Signature Size

| Curve       | Key Size | Signature Size |
|-------------|----------|----------------|
| secp256k1   | 256-bit  | 64 bytes       |
| secp521r1   | 521-bit  | 132 bytes      |

---

## Public Key Recovery

ECDSA allows public key recovery from:
- Signature `{r, s}`
- Message `msg`

### Extended Signature
- Format: `{r, s, v}` (with recovery ID `v`)
- Used in Ethereum and other blockchains

### Use Case
- Saves bandwidth and storage by not transmitting the public key separately

---

## Summary

| Component     | Description                                   |
|---------------|-----------------------------------------------|
| `privKey`     | Random integer ‚àà `[1, n - 1]`                  |
| `pubKey`      | EC point: `privKey * G`                        |
| `r`           | x-coordinate of `R = k * G`                    |
| `s`           | Signature proof using `privKey` and `msg hash`|
| Signature     | `{r, s}` or `{r, s, v}`                        |

# Diffie-Hellman Key Exchange (DHKE) Cheatsheet

The Diffie-Hellman Key Exchange (DHKE) is a method for securely exchanging cryptographic keys over a public channel. It enables two parties to jointly establish a shared secret used for encrypted communication.

---

## üîë Key Concepts

- **Asymmetric Key Exchange**: Uses public and private keys.
- **Symmetric Key Usage**: Resulting shared secret is used with symmetric encryption.
- **Security Based On**: Discrete logarithm problem (hard to reverse).

---

## üìö Terminology

- `p`: A large prime number (public).
- `g`: A primitive root modulo `p` (public).
- `a`: Alice‚Äôs private key (secret).
- `b`: Bob‚Äôs private key (secret).
- `A`: Alice‚Äôs public key = `g^a mod p`.
- `B`: Bob‚Äôs public key = `g^b mod p`.
- `s`: Shared secret = `B^a mod p = A^b mod p`.

---

## üîê Step-by-Step Process

1. **Public Setup**  
   Both parties agree on a large prime `p` and a generator `g`.

2. **Private Key Generation**  
   Each party picks a private key:
   - Alice: chooses `a`
   - Bob: chooses `b`

3. **Public Key Computation**  
   Each party computes and shares their public key:
   - Alice: `A = g^a mod p`
   - Bob: `B = g^b mod p`

4. **Shared Secret Derivation**  
   Each computes the shared secret:
   - Alice: `s = B^a mod p`
   - Bob: `s = A^b mod p`

---

## üìÑ Example (with small numbers)

```
p = 23
g = 5

Alice:
  a = 6
  A = 5^6 mod 23 = 8

Bob:
  b = 15
  B = 5^15 mod 23 = 2

Exchange:
  Alice sends A = 8
  Bob sends B = 2

Shared Secret:
  Alice: s = 2^6 mod 23 = 18
  Bob: s = 8^15 mod 23 = 18
```

Both compute the same shared secret: `s = 18`

---

## üß† Security

- **Depends On**: Difficulty of computing discrete logarithms in a finite field.
- **Eavesdropper Sees**: `p`, `g`, `A`, `B` but cannot compute the shared secret without solving the discrete log problem.

---

## üîÅ Variants

- **Elliptic Curve Diffie-Hellman (ECDH)**  
  Uses elliptic curves for improved performance and smaller keys.

- **Ephemeral Diffie-Hellman (DHE)**  
  Uses fresh key pairs per session to enable perfect forward secrecy.

---

## üß™ Python Example

```python
import random

def diffie_hellman(p, g):
    a = random.randint(1, p - 2)
    b = random.randint(1, p - 2)

    A = pow(g, a, p)
    B = pow(g, b, p)

    s_A = pow(B, a, p)
    s_B = pow(A, b, p)

    assert s_A == s_B
    return s_A

shared_secret = diffie_hellman(23, 5)
print("Shared Secret:", shared_secret)
```

---

## üõ°Ô∏è Applications

- HTTPS (TLS)
- VPNs
- Messaging apps (e.g. Signal)
- Secure file sharing

# RSA Cryptosystem Cheatsheet

The RSA cryptosystem is an asymmetric encryption algorithm based on the mathematical difficulty of factoring large integers. It is widely used for secure data transmission.

---

## üîê Key Concepts

- **Asymmetric encryption**: Uses a public key to encrypt and a private key to decrypt.
- **Based on**: The difficulty of factoring the product of two large prime numbers.
- **Applications**: Secure communication, digital signatures, key exchange.

---

## üìö Terminology

- `p`, `q`: Two large distinct prime numbers.
- `n`: The modulus, `n = p * q`.
- `œÜ(n)`: Euler's totient function, `œÜ(n) = (p-1)(q-1)`.
- `e`: Public exponent such that `1 < e < œÜ(n)` and `gcd(e, œÜ(n)) = 1`.
- `d`: Private exponent, `d ‚â° e‚Åª¬π mod œÜ(n)`.
- `m`: Plaintext message (as a number).
- `c`: Ciphertext message.

---

## üîß Key Generation

1. Choose two large prime numbers: `p` and `q`.
2. Compute `n = p * q`.
3. Compute `œÜ(n) = (p - 1)(q - 1)`.
4. Choose public exponent `e` such that `gcd(e, œÜ(n)) = 1`.
5. Compute private exponent `d` as the modular inverse of `e` modulo `œÜ(n)`.

Public Key: `(n, e)`  
Private Key: `(n, d)`

---

## üîí Encryption & Decryption

- **Encryption**  
  To encrypt a message `m` using the public key `(n, e)`:
  ```
  c = m^e mod n
  ```

- **Decryption**  
  To decrypt a ciphertext `c` using the private key `(n, d)`:
  ```
  m = c^d mod n
  ```

---

## üìÑ Example (with small numbers)

```
p = 61
q = 53
n = p * q = 3233
œÜ(n) = (p-1)*(q-1) = 3120
e = 17
d = 2753 (because 17 * 2753 ‚â° 1 mod 3120)

Public Key: (3233, 17)
Private Key: (3233, 2753)

Message: m = 65
Encryption: c = 65^17 mod 3233 = 2790
Decryption: m = 2790^2753 mod 3233 = 65
```

---

## üß™ Python Example

```python
from Crypto.Util.number import getPrime, inverse
import random

def generate_rsa_keys(bits=512):
    p = getPrime(bits)
    q = getPrime(bits)
    n = p * q
    phi = (p - 1) * (q - 1)
    e = 65537
    d = inverse(e, phi)
    return (n, e), (n, d)

def encrypt(m, pubkey):
    n, e = pubkey
    return pow(m, e, n)

def decrypt(c, privkey):
    n, d = privkey
    return pow(c, d, n)

pub, priv = generate_rsa_keys()
message = 42
cipher = encrypt(message, pub)
plain = decrypt(cipher, priv)
print("Original:", message)
print("Encrypted:", cipher)
print("Decrypted:", plain)
```

---

## üõ°Ô∏è Security

- **Security relies on**: Difficulty of factoring large integers.
- **Key size**: Typically 2048 or 3072 bits.
- **Vulnerabilities**:
  - Poor random number generation
  - Small `e` without padding (e.g., textbook RSA)
  - Timing and side-channel attacks

---

## üìé Use Cases

- SSL/TLS (HTTPS)
- PGP/GPG
- Digital signatures
- Secure key exchange

---

## üß† Best Practices

- Use padding schemes like OAEP or PKCS#1 v1.5.
- Avoid using RSA to encrypt large messages directly.
- Use hybrid encryption (RSA + AES).
- Rotate keys periodically.
